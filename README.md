# Karnataka-Election-Results-2023
The Karnataka 2023 Legislative Assembly elections, held on May 10, resulted in a decisive victory for the Indian National Congress (INC), which secured 135 seats out of 224 in the state assembly. This outcome allowed the Congress to form the government in Karnataka, ending the Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) rule in the state. The BJP, which had been in power since 2018, won only 66 seats, while the Janata Dal (Secular) (JD(S)) secured 19 seats. The Congress's victory was seen as a major boost to the party ahead of the 2024 general elections. The INC's success was attributed to a strong anti-incumbency sentiment, promises of welfare schemes, and effective campaigning.
